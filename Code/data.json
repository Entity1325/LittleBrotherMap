        "Text": "The Battle of Cable Street was a series of clashes that took place at several locations in the inner East End of London, most notably Cable Street, on Sunday 4 October 1936. It was a clash between the Metropolitan Police, sent to protect a march by members of the British Union of Fascists led by Oswald Mosley, and various de jure and de facto anti-fascist demonstrators, including local trade unionists, communists, anarchists, British Jews, supported in particular by Irish workers, and socialist groups. The anti-fascist counter-demonstration included both organised and unaffiliated participants.",
